The changes to the Light Enhancement and Attention layers help in several ways for crater detection:

### Light Enhancement Module:
1. **Improved Feature Extraction:**
   - **Multiple Convolution Layers:** Capture more complex and varied features, enhancing details in the input images.
   - **Batch Normalization:** Stabilizes training, allowing the model to converge faster and improve generalization.

2. **Enhanced Contrast:**
   - By improving feature visibility, this module helps highlight craters and other surface features, which is crucial for accurate detection.

### Attention Module:
1. **Focus on Relevant Features:**
   - **Channel-wise Attention:** Helps the model focus on important features by adjusting the significance of different regions in the image.
   - **Increased Sensitivity:** The attention mechanism makes the model more sensitive to variations in crater shapes and textures.

2. **Noise Reduction:**
   - By focusing on relevant features, the module reduces the influence of irrelevant background details, improving detection accuracy.

### Overall Impact:
- **Better Detection:** Enhanced modules contribute to improved detection rates and accuracy by focusing on meaningful features.
- **Robustness to Variability:** The model becomes more robust to lighting changes and surface variability, which is important for lunar images.
- **Improved Convergence:** Enhanced feature extraction and attention mechanisms aid in faster and more stable training.

These modifications are designed to improve the model's ability to detect and distinguish craters from the lunar surface, especially under challenging conditions.
